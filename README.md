# 🐢🏎Turtle Road Crossing Game using Turtle module of Python

🌟Built the Fun and Interactive Road Crossing Game using the concept of OOP and Python Classes, Multiple Object instances, Class Inheritance, Event Listeners and more.

👉The Player Class which inherits from Turtle class designs the player object and its methods of movement in player.py file

👉The CarManager class present in car_manager.py file is used to generate the random car objects and their movement speed as well as direction is charaterised
using appropriate methods.

👉The user's score and level is tracked in scoreboard.py file using the Scoreboard class inheriting from Turtle class. The user's score is updated on every
successful crossing and the game over sequel is run when a collision is detected using methods in this class.

👉The main.py file performs the complete implementation of the game. The use of Screen class to create screen object for the game and its methods like tracer, listen to 
user key inputs and exitonclick provide added functionality to the game.

👉The functions of collision detection of player and car are performed here. Also the level up operation on successful crossing is implemented in the main.py with the
help of the appropriate methods defined in the above mentioned classes.
